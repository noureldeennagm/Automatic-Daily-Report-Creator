# Automatic-Daily-Report-Creator
In my last job I was required to create a daily report showing my daily tasks and how long did I work on each task. As a person who have a terrible memory this has been a very time consuming and a frustrating task to do.   Later when I was intruduced to GitHub and python repos overall I learned that coding is all about automating such tasks that are easy but takes alot of time.  In this repository I will explain to you how was I able to automatically track my computer activity and export it into an excell file using two repos I found.
